## Files Description:

### 1. `primitives.py`

Collection of gates and matrices required for ququart simulations (not a
notebook).

### 2. `qiskit_evolve.py`

This Python script demonstrates the simulation of Fermi-Hubbard evolution using
Qiskit.

### 3. `ququart.py`

This Python script showcases Ququart simulation using Cirq. It includes:

- Implementation of evolution dynamics for ququart system using decomposed
  (through OSD) gates.

## General Information:

- **Execution**: These notebooks can be executed using Jupyter with Jupytext.
  Simply open the notebook in your preferred environment and execute the cells
  to observe the simulation results.

  For more information see:
